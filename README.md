# C346 Project 1
The first homework assignment for the Spring 18' C346 class

## Goal
The goal of this assigment is to create an implementation of the 'ILinkedList.java' interface that was given during class. Unit tests are then to be designed and ran to effectively test the code in a modular way.

## Implementation
'MyLinkedList.java' is the implementation of the interface given in class and can be found in the [C346_Project1/src directory](https://github.com/AlreadyAsleep/C346_Project_1/tree/master/C346_Project1/src)
