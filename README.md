# C346 Project 1
The first homework assignment for the Spring 18' C346 class

## Goal
The goal of this assigment is to create an implementation of the 'ILinkedList.java' interface that was given during class. Unit tests are then to be designed and ran to effectively test the code in a modular way.

## Implementation
'MyLinkedList.java' is the implementation of the interface given in class and can be found in the [C346_Project1/src directory](https://github.com/AlreadyAsleep/C346_Project_1/tree/master/C346_Project1/src)
The unit tests for 'MyLinkedList.java' can be found in the same directory in the file 'MyLinkedListTest.java' and use the JUNIT4 unit test library.

## Documentation
There is a complete Javadoc for 'MyLinkedList.java' located in the C346_Project1/doc directory. To view it, clone this repository and then simply open the file 'C346_Project1/doc/index.html'
